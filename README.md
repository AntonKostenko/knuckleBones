# Knuckle Bones
A clone of the mini-game "Knuckle Bones" from the game "Cult of the Lamb." 
Made in Python using the Arcade engine.

## Getting Started

## How to play

* Place a dice in any column on your board using the mouse. The dice value is added to your column score.
* Your total score is calculated by adding all of your column scores together.
* When dice of the same value are placed in the same column, the dice value is multiplied.
* Destroy your opponents dice by matching yours to theirs in the same column.
* The game ends when either board fills up. The winner is the player with the highest score.
